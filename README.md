# CrossTheGameQT
My Final Year QT Project. Made with QT framework with C++. 


“Cross the Game” is a multiplayer game written in Qt framework 5.5.1 with C++.  It can run on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms without any issues. Most of the code base is not platform specific. The platform specific code has been nested with #if statements to make sure the program works in other platforms.

 

Qt Creator 3.5.1 has been used to make the GUI. Below describes the UI elements and their workload. To see the real-world application on the GUI, please refer the link below.
